React, node, js.

Takes in ASCII formatted tab, as is normally found on sites like Ultimate Guitar etc, and outputs a web page containing formatted guitar tab, all rendered using native react / dom elements.

Early days as yet - lots of formatting and edge cases to work through. One day I'd like to integrate a midi lbrary so that tabs can be played.
